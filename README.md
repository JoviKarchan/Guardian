# Guardian 🔒✨  
**AI + Blockchain for a distraction-free, accountable internet.**

---

## 🚨 Problem  
The internet is full of engineered distractions:  
- 🎰 Gambling sites that trap users in financial losses.  
- 📱 Social media feeds that drain productivity and attention.  
- ❌ Adult or harmful content that creates unhealthy patterns.  

Traditional blockers fail because they are:  
- Easy to bypass.  
- Centralized and untrustworthy.  
- Impersonal — they don’t actually *understand the user*.  
- Lacking in long-term accountability.
